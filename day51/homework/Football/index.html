                <p><i>Football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field <br>
                    called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a <br>
                     rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match <br>
                      time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.</i></p>

                <p><i>The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and <br>
                     maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference. The two teams compete to <br>
                      get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the bar, and across the goal line), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in <br>
                       play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. <br>
                        Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the <br>
                         game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call or a foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending <br>
                          on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored may result in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a <br>
                           penalty shoot-out.</i></p>

                <p><i>Internationally, association football is governed by FIFA. Under FIFA, there are six continental confederations: AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, <br>
                     CONMEBOL, OFC, and UEFA. Of these confederations, CONMEBOL is the oldest one, being founded in 1916. National associations (e.g. The <br>
                      FA or JFA) are responsible for managing the game in their own countries both professionally and at an amateur level, and coordinating <br>
                       competitions in accordance with the Laws of the Game. The most senior and prestigious international competitions are the FIFA World Cup and <br>
                        the FIFA Women's World Cup. The men's World Cup is the most-viewed sporting event in the world, surpassing the Olympic Games.[6] The two <br>
                         most prestigious competitions in European club football are the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League, which <br>
                          attract an extensive television audience throughout the world. Since 2009, the final of the men's tournament has been the most-watched annual <br>
                           sporting event in the world.</i></p>
