                <p><i>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the <br>
                     primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) <br>
                      in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through <br>
                       their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops <br>
                        and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the <br>
                         end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</i></p>

                <p><i>Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable <br>
                     skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler,<br>
                      intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard. It is <br>
                       a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</i></p>

                <p><i>The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power <br>
                     forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard <br>
                      and the point guard, who implement the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). <br>
                       Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.</i></p>

                <p><i>Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States, basketball has evolved <br>
                     to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.[1][2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant <br>
                      professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most of its talent from <br>
                       U.S. college basketball). Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the <br>
                        EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas. The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are <br>
                         the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions for <br>
                          national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup</i></p>
