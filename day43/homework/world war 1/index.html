                <p class="about"><i>World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918) was a global <br>
                     conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. <br>
                      Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as parts of <br>
                       Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and was characterised by trench warfare and the use <br>
                        of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas). World War I was one of <br>
                         the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 9 million military <br>
                          dead and 23 million wounded, plus up to 8 million civilian deaths from causes <br>
                           including genocide. The movement of large numbers of troops and civilians was <br>
                            a major factor in spreading the Spanish flu pandemic.</i></p>

                <p class="about2"><i>The causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the balance of power in place in Europe <br>
                     for most of the 19th century, as well as increased economic competition between nations triggered by new waves of industrialisation and imperialism. <br>
                      Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip <br>
                       assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. <br>
                        Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, and by 4 August, Germany, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom were drawn into the war, with the Ottomans <br>
                         joining in November of the same year. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France, then to transfer its forces to the Russian front. <br>
                          However, this failed, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to <br>
                           Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. As the fighting expanded <br>
                            to more fronts, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward.</i></p>

                <p class="about3"><i>In April 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side following Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic <br>
                     shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in the Russian October Revolution, after which Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central <br>
                      Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched an offensive in the west, which despite initial successes <br>
                       left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. A successful Allied counter-offensive from August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line. By <br>
                        early November, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a <br>
                         revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.</i></p>

                <p class="about4"><i>The Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920 imposed various settlements on the defeated powers, most notably the Treaty of Versailles, by which <br>
                     Germany lost significant territories, was disarmed, and was required to pay large sums of war reparations to the Allies. The dissolution of the Russian, <br>
                      German, Austro-Hungarian, and Ottoman Empires redrew national boundaries and resulted in the creation of new independent states, including <br>
                       Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The League of Nations was established to maintain world peace, but its failure <br>
                        to manage instability during the interwar period contributed to the outbreak of World War II in 1939.</i></p>
