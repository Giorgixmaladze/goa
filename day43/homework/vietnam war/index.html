                <p><i>The Vietnam War was a conflict in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from 1 November 1955 to the fall <br>
                     of Saigon on 30 April 1975. It was the second of the Indochina Wars and a major conflict of the Cold <br>
                      War. While the war was officially fought between North Vietnam and South Vietnam, the north was <br>
                       supported by the Soviet Union, China, and other communist states, while the south was supported by the <br>
                        US and anti-communist allies. This made it a proxy war between the US and Soviet Union. It lasted <br>
                         almost 20 years, with direct US military involvement ending in 1973. The conflict spilled into the Laotian <br>
                          and Cambodian civil wars, which ended with all three countries becoming communist in 1975.</i></p>

                <p><i>After the fall of French Indochina with the 1954 Geneva Conference, the country gained independence <br>
                     from France but was divided into two parts: the Viet Minh took control of North Vietnam, while the US <br>
                      assumed financial and military support for South Vietnam. The Viet Cong (VC), a South Vietnamese <br>
                       common front under the direction of the north, initiated guerrilla war in the south. The People's Army of <br>
                        Vietnam (PAVN) engaged in more conventional warfare with US and Army of the Republic of Vietnam <br>
                         (ARVN) forces. North Vietnam invaded Laos in 1958, establishing the Ho Chi Minh trail to supply and <br>
                          reinforce the VC.By 1963, the north had sent 40,000 soldiers to fight in the south. US involvement <br>
                           increased under President John F. Kennedy, from 1,000 military advisors in 1959 to 23,000 by 1964.</i></p>

                <p><i>Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, the US Congress passed a resolution that gave President <br>
                     Johnson authority to increase military presence, without a declaration of war. Johnson ordered <br>
                      deployment of combat units and dramatically increased American troops to US and South Vietnamese <br>
                       forces relied on air supremacy and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations. <br>
                        The US conducted a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam and built up its forces, despite <br>
                         little progress. In 1968, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive; a tactical defeat, but a strategic <br>
                          victory, as it caused US domestic support to fade. In 1969, North Vietnam declared the Provisional  <br>
                          Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam. The 1970 deposing of Cambodia's <br>
                           monarch, resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country, and then a US-ARVN counter-invasion, escalating <br>
                            Cambodia's Civil War. After Richard Nixon's election in 1969, a policy of "Vietnamization" began, which <br>
                             saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, while US forces withdrew due to domestic opposition. US <br>
                              ground forces had mostly withdrawn by 1972, the 1973 Paris Peace Accords saw all US forces <br>
                               withdrawn and were broken almost immediately: fighting continued for two years. Phnom Penh fell to <br>
                                the Khmer Rouge in April 1975, while the 1975 spring offensive saw the Fall of Saigon to the PAVN, <br>
                                 marking the end of the war. North and South Vietnam were reunified on 2 July the following year.</i></p>

                <p><i>The war exacted enormous human cost: estimates of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed range from <br>
                     970,000 to 3 million. Some 275,000–310,000 Cambodians, 20,000–62,000 Laotians, and 58,220 US <br>
                      service members died. Its end would precipitate the Vietnamese boat people and the larger Indochina <br>
                       refugee crisis, which saw millions leave Indochina, an estimated 250,000 perished at sea. The Khmer <br>
                        Rouge carried out the Cambodian genocide, while conflict between them and the unified Vietnam <br>
                         escalated into the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. In response, China invaded Vietnam, with border <br>
                          conflicts lasting until 1991. Within the US, the war gave rise to Vietnam syndrome, a public aversion to <br>
                           American overseas military involvement, which, with the Watergate scandal, contributed to the crisis of <br>
                            confidence that affected America throughout the 1970s. The US destroyed 20% of South Vietnam's jungle <br>
                             and 20–50% of the mangrove forests, by spraying over 20 million U.S. gallons (75 million liters) of toxic <br>
                              herbicides; a notable example of ecocide.</i></p>
