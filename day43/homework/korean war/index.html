                <p><i>The Korean War (25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) was an armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula fought between North Korea (Democratic <br>
                     People's Republic of Korea; DPRK) and South Korea (Republic of Korea; ROK) and their allies. North Korea was supported by the People's <br>
                      Republic of China and the Soviet Union, while South Korea was supported by the United Nations Command (UNC) led by the United States. <br>
                       Fighting ended in 1953 with an armistice, with no treaty signed.</i></p>

                <p><i>After the end of World War II in 1945, Korea, which had been a Japanese colony for 35 years, was divided by the Soviet Union and US into two <br>
                     occupation zones at the 38th parallel, with plans for a future independent state. Due to political disagreements and influence from their backers, <br>
                      the zones formed their own governments in 1948. The DPRK was led by Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang, and the ROK by Syngman Rhee in Seoul; <br>
                       both claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and engaged in limited battles. On 25 June 1950, the Korean People's Army <br>
                        (KPA), equipped and trained by the Soviets, launched an invasion of the south. In the absence of the Soviet Union, the UN Security Council <br>
                         denounced the attack and recommended countries to repel the invasion. UN forces comprised 21 countries, with the US providing around 90% <br>
                          of military personnel.</i></p>

                <p><i>After two months, the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) and its allies were nearly defeated, holding onto only the Pusan Perimeter. In September <br>
                     1950, however, UN forces landed at Inchon, cutting off KPA troops and supply lines. They invaded North Korea in October 1950 and advanced <br>
                      towards the Yalu River—the border with China. On 19 October 1950, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered <br>
                       the war. UN forces retreated from North Korea in December, following the PVA's first and second offensive. Communist forces captured <br>
                        Seoul again in January 1951 before losing it two months later. Following the abortive Chinese spring offensive, they were pushed back to the <br>
                         38th parallel, and the final two years of the fighting turned into a war of attrition.</i></p>

                <p><i>The combat ended on 27 July 1953 when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, allowing the exchange of prisoners and creating the Korean <br>
                     Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The conflict displaced millions of people, inflicting 3 million fatalities and a larger proportion of civilian deaths than <br>
                      World War II or the Vietnam War. Alleged war crimes include the killing of suspected communists by Seoul and the torture and starvation of prisoners <br>
                       of war by the North Koreans. North Korea became one of the most heavily bombed countries in history, and virtually all of <br>
                       Korea's major cities were destroyed. No peace treaty was ever signed, making the war a frozen conflict</i></p>
